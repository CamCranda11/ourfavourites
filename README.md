# When selecting the license, we decided to go with the Boost Software License V1.0 because it seemed to be the most simple and least restrictive licensing option. It grants permission for anyone to use the files free of charnge since this assignment isn't a project that requires any sort of copyright protection. When choosing we considered what we were actually making with this project and since it's just a few text files we see no reason for any sort of complex licensing, and just went with something that doesn't have any sort of major restrictions.
